‚õìÔ∏è Stacks & Queues Lesson

JS data structures:
Objects {} - store things in key-value pairs
Arrays [] - store things in an ordered sequence

Examples of some Data Structures
Stacks - Call stack
Queues
Hash Tables - caching, indexing
Trees Tries - Text auto-complete
Graphs - Machine Learning, Google maps

Apply the right tool for the job ^^


Strengths of Stack & Queue (Compared to regular old arrays)
* Instant insertion & deletion

Weakness
* Can only access the top/front item
