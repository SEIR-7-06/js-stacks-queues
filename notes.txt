Computer Science Topics:
Data Structures & Algorithms

🍎 Algorithms
The procedure for solving computational problems
(with the eventual goal of writing *efficient* code)

🍏 Data Structures
The ways in which we as programmers can *organize* data 
in computer systems.

JS data structures:
Arrays [] - store items in an ordered sequence
Objects {} - store items in key-value pairs


⛓️ Stack & Queues Lesson

Stack: LIFO (Last in First out)
Queue: FIFO (First in First out)

Strengths of Stacks & Queues (compared to regular arrays)
* Instant insertion & deletion - O(1)

Weakness
* You can only access the top item / the front item
